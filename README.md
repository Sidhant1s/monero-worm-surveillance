# Worm-Assisted Filter Surveillance Attack on Monero

**Author**: Sidhant Negi  
**Status**: Draft for Peer Review (June 2025)

---

## 📌 Summary

This project introduces a nation-scale, Tier-1 level threat model that could undermine the privacy guarantees of Monero (XMR). By leveraging worm-assisted endpoint behavior analysis and encrypted traffic filtering, it explores how real users can be deanonymized.

---

## 🔍 Key Concepts

- **Entropy-Based Packet Filtering**
- **Worm Behavior Triggered by Monero Traffic**
- **Wallet Behavior Differentiation**
- **Nationwide Surveillance Assumptions**

---

## 🛡️ Bypassing Dandelion++ and Ring Signatures

- Dandelion++ assumes only partial node compromise.
- This model assumes total ISP-level access, making it ineffective.
- Endpoint worms are used to probe wallets after packet path logging.
